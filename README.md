# 🌟 My Web Development Portfolio & Project Showcase 🌟

Welcome to my central repository for all things web development! This collection features a variety of projects, ranging from sleek front-end designs using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to fully functional, database-driven applications.

### 💡 What's Inside?

This repository serves as a live portfolio, demonstrating my capabilities across the full development lifecycle, including:

* **Mini-Applications (MERN Stack):** Small, focused apps like the **Mini-Chat** (built with Express, MongoDB, and EJS) that showcase full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation.
* **Modern UI/UX Designs:** Projects prioritizing aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and highly interactive user interfaces, utilizing advanced CSS techniques (like Flexbox, Grid, and gradients).
* **Vanilla JavaScript Interactivity:** Examples of complex logic and DOM manipulation built purely with plain JavaScript, without relying on external libraries.
* **Responsive Design:** Every project is optimized to look fantastic on any device, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
